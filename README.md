## Project Overview
This repository contains SQL queries from the Rockbuster Stealth project. The goal was to help management understand customer behavior, rentals, and movie preferences across multiple locations, enabling data-driven decisions.

### Key business questions addressed include:
- Which customers are most profitable?  
- How do rental trends vary by location and time?  
- Which movies or genres are most popular among different customer segments?  

All queries were written in PostgreSQL and were used to generate Tableau dashboards for visual insights.

## Dataset
The dataset includes anonymized customer transactions, rentals, and movie information. Data was cleaned and structured to ensure accurate analysis.
