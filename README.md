## Project Overview
This repository contains SQL queries from the Rockbuster Stealth project. The goal was to help management **understand customer behavior, rentals, and movie preferences** across multiple locations, enabling data-driven decisions.

Key business questions addressed include:  
- Which customers are most profitable?  
- How do rental trends vary by location and time?  
- Which movies or genres are most popular among different customer segments?

All queries were written in PostgreSQL and were used to generate Tableau dashboards for **visual insights**.

## Dataset
The dataset includes anonymized customer transactions, rentals, and movie information. Data was cleaned and structured to ensure accurate analysis.
